# Project Description

This repo contains a test project created during Northcoders final group project.

The main project is Bibliotech - a peer-to-peer booklending app:
https://github.com/defective-pikachu

Both this project and Bibliotech were created using React Native with Expo, linked to Firebase Firestore database.

# React Native with Expo setup:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

    npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject

    cd AwesomeProject

    npm start 

(You can also use: npx expo start)

# Firebase Firestore:

https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore

Both this application and Bibliotech were added to Firebase as web applications.

While Bibliotech uses Firebase authorisation, this project does not.

This project is a sandbox for writing a new book object to the Firestore database.

When transferring this functionality to Bibliotech, we also included a field for to capture authorised user's unique id from Firebase.auth.

We also made our addBook form require input for only 'title', author details and location, as the rest of the data will not be gathered using user input.
